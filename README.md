# Peer Posties NZ - peer-to-peer delivery

### 2nd place winner of Hack the Crisis NZ 2020 hackathon

This is a project/pitch planed and developed in less than 48h by a team of 10 people, including me, during Hack the Crisis NZ 2020 (17-19 April). I contributed to building the database in SQLite, APIâ€™s and components in React.

The organisers of this hackathon challenged Kiwis to design, test and bring to life innovative ideas for life in New Zealand beyond COVID-19.

The goal was finding innovative solutions to problems brought about by COVID-19 inside three themes:

- Supporting businesses
- Connecting communities
- Resilience and wellbeing

This repository contains the code of what could be finished in time to present the idea to the judges.

The project went to the Top 8 finalist and after that, one of the three runner-ups - 2nd equal winner.

## Run the project

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`. The assets built by Webpack are placed in `server/public`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with `npm run server`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.

## Separate client/server

The client is also set up to be hosted using `webpack-dev-server` with hot module reloading etc. To use this method, in one terminal run:

```shn
npm run client
```

and in the other:

```sh
npm run server
```

The client will be available on http://localhost:8080 and the server on http://localhost:3000. Note that you will still need to manage CORS between the two, as they are on different ports.
